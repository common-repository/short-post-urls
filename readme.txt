Shortened Post URLs for twitter or any other social network that may need a short url. Default short URL is http://siteurl.com/p/175 ( where 175 is the post id ) but can easily be changed to whatever you'd like ( maybe http://siteurl.com/175 ). 

Example template modifications would be "<a class="share-via-twitter" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Reading: <?php the_title(); ?> <?php echo get_option('home'); ?>/s/<?php the_ID(); ?>" title="Tweet this post">Tweet This</a>"
